# Map for WinForms - Load Image Tiles From Bing Maps

This example shows how to load raster image tiles from the Bing Maps imagery service and add a [mini map](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/17683/controls-and-libraries/map-control/visual-elements/mini-map?p=netframework) to the map.

Use the [BingMapDataProvider](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraMap.BingMapDataProvider?p=netframework) to load tiles from Bing Maps. You also need a key for working with Bing Maps. For instructions on how to register for a Bing Maps account and create a key for it, refer to the following help topic: [How to: Get a Bing Maps Key](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/15102/controls-and-libraries/map-control/examples/general/how-to-get-a-bing-maps-key).
